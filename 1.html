		<p>Our village is a peaceful, noiseless, pollution free and a beautiful place.For its location and cool environment,<br>
		one can enjoy the beauty of nature.Every year, during our summer vacations we used to visit our village. Due to scarce population,<br>
		people do not reside too cloose to one another. Even our cottage is at a distance from other cottages.Flowers,fruits,trees,small plants<br>
		and vegetables surround our cottage.All this makes the surrounding look green and fresh. One can see mountain at a distance touching the clouds<br>
		This further beautifies the surrounding.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">It takes 2 days to reach our town by train. During our travel,me<br>
		and my elder brother would always fight for the window seat. The journey would be completely tiring but excited to see our grandparents who would be<br>
		waiting to receive us.Living among such friendly and simple people is certainly a real pleasure.</span></p>
